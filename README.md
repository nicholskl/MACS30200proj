# MACS30200proj
Kris Nichols' MACS 30200 Research Project

## This project was completed in fulfillment of my Perpsectives in Computational Research course at the University of Chicago. 
### This project looked to answer a few questions:
- How does abnormal weather affect climate change concern?
- How have past research methods been insufficient in answering these questions?
- How can Google Search Data serve as a better proxy for climate change concern?

**The final paper has been uploaded and the code can be found in the same folder.
